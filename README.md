# Dog-Breed-Finder
### Identifying the different breeds of dogs
The jupyter Notebook is self explanatory and you can follow it to implement it.
Link for the dataset used has been provided within the notebook itself.
The classification problem has been tackled in 2 ways here:- 
1: 120 class Classification
2: 10 class Classification
Testing of both the models created has also been done in the notenook and you can see that.
Thank you..
Happy coding.
