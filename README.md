# Dog-Breed-Finder

### Identifying the different breeds of dogs
- The jupyter Notebook is self explanatory and you can follow it to implement it.
- Link for the dataset used has been provided within the notebook itself.
The classification problem has been tackled in 2 ways here:- 
- 1: 120 class Classification
- 2: 10 class Classification
Testing of both the models created has also been done in the notebook and you can see that.
Thank you..
Happy coding.
